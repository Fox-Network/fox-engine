This repository contains a data pack for the game Minecraft with which you can turn into a fox, explore the world, jump around and doing everything that... uhh... foxes do all day long.

# 💫 Vision of the Fox Engine

Our vision is to create a small but wonderful designed data pack that implements as best as possible all the functions of a real Mineraft Fox and make them usable for players.

# ✨ Features

### 🗡️ Holding items in mouth

Items that you hold in your main hand will also displayed in the fox's mouth.

### 🐇 Jump-System

Hold your sneak button to charge the fox jump. When your fox jump is fully charged, you can jump up to two blocks high!

### 🪀 Sneak, Sit & Sleep-Animations

Let your fox automatically sneak with you. With commands you can even make the fox sit or sleep in his comfy bed.

### 👥 Multiplayer Support

The data pack is also multiplayer friendly. This means that you can play with your friends up to 6 players (max. **3 red & 3 artic**) at the same time on a server!
