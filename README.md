----

This repository contains a data pack for the game Minecraft with which you can turn into a fox, explore the world, jump around and doing everything that... uhh... foxes do all day long.

# 💫 Vision of the Fox Engine

Our vision is to create a small but wonderful designed data pack that implements as best as possible all the functions of a real Mineraft Fox and make them usable for players.

# ✨ Features

### 🗡️ Holding items in mouth

Items that you hold in your main hand will also displayed in the fox's mouth. 

### 🐇 Jump-System

Hold your sneak button to charge the fox jump. When your fox jump is fully charged, you can jump up to two blocks high!

### 🪀 Sneak, Sit & Sleep-Animations

When you sneak, ride animals or sleep in your comfy bed, the fox also has the same animation as you.

### 👥 Multiplayer Support

The data pack is also multiplayer friendly. This means that you can play with your friends up to 6 players (max. **3 red & 3 artic**) at the same time on a server!
